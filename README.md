# Galaxy-Classification
Classifying different kinds of Galaxys utilizing a dataset provided by astronn 
The repo does not include the data utilized since it can be easily accessed using this link https://astronn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/galaxy10.html 

The purpose of this project was to attempt a simple deep learning format of a project, and when I saw that this file contained around 22000 images with 10 different galaxy types, I decided to give it a spin just to see if I was able to design a neural netowrk that would be able to somewhat function


TODO: Machine Learning:
  1. Complete More Trainings in General
  2. Try out different methods to understand what the best parameters for this type of training could be
  3. Using this model to have real predictions since as of now there are only softmax predictions available
